# Flutter Widget

> The navigation drawer is a UI panel that shows your appâ€™s main
> navigation menu. It is hidden when not in use, but appears when the
> user swipes a finger from the left edge of the screen or, when at the
> top level of the app, the user touches the drawer icon in the app bar.
